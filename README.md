# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_FINANCIAL_DATA_ANALYSIS

In collaboration with UNP Education, I completed a Power BI project focused on analyzing a company’s retail financial dataset and transforming it into meaningful business insights.The project involved structured data analysis, beginning with data cleaning by fixing inconsistencies to ensure accuracy and reliability. Post data preparation, I developed DAX measures to support advanced analytical insights. Key performance metrics were created, including Total Cost, Total Discount, Total Sales, Total Gross Margin, Total Loss, Total Profit, Total Manufacturing Cost, Total Units Sold, Profit per Unit, and Cost per Unit to evaluate overall business performance. I designed a dashboard titled “Orion Enterprises Financial Performance Analysis Dashboard,” which provides a holistic view of business performance. It includes various visualizations such as charts and geographic maps to analyze sales, profit trends, product performance, and regional distribution. The dashboard helped identify key problem areas and provided valuable insights to support better business decisions. Overall, this project offered valuable hands-on experience and significantly strengthened my ability to analyze financial data.
